# Seed 2.0: ByteDance's Production-Grade LLM — The AI Engine Behind Doubao's Hundreds of Millions of Users

> **TL;DR**: ByteDance Seed team launches **Seed 2.0** — the LLM engine powering Doubao and other products with hundreds of millions of users. Focus: **production-grade deployment** for complex real-world tasks. Four models (Pro/Lite/Mini/Code). LMSYS Arena **#6 text, #3 vision**. Beats GPT-5.2 on SuperGPQA, competitive on FrontierSci. Token pricing **~10x cheaper** than leading models.

## Key Insight
Most MaaS requests are knowledge-intensive tasks from unstructured sources (charts, documents, long text). Companies need "heavy reading + deep thinking" before complex professional workflows — not math olympiad solving.

## Model Family
- **Pro**: Flagship, strongest multimodal + scientific reasoning
- **Lite**: Balanced performance/cost
- **Mini**: Low latency, high throughput
- **Code**: Dedicated code generation

## Multimodal: Comprehensive SOTA
- Visual reasoning: SOTA on MathVista, MathVision, MathKangaroo, MathCanvas
- Document understanding: Top-tier on ChartQAPro, OmniDocBench 1.5
- Long context: Best on DUDE, MMLongBench, MMLongBench-Doc
- Video: Surpasses human on EgoTempo; real-time video streaming QA
- LMSYS Vision Arena: **#3**

## Agent Capabilities
- SuperGPQA > GPT-5.2; FrontierSci partially > GPT-5.2
- ICPC/IMO/CMO gold medal results
- AInstein Bench **#1** — hypothesis-driven scientific reasoning
- Can turn "research ideas" into executable experiment plans

## Cost Advantage
Same performance as leading models, **~10x cheaper** token pricing. Critical for real-world tasks consuming massive tokens.
