## The Editing Bottleneck in the Video Era

2025 was unquestionably the year of video. AI-generated ads went mainstream, launch videos from seed-stage startups got millions of views, and video podcasts and interviews exploded.

But behind every polished video lies a brutal reality: **80% of video production time and energy goes to editing**, with only 20% spent on filming (or now, generating). Cutting 90 minutes of footage into a three-minute short, correcting lighting and audio in post-production, searching for the right music — it's a long, tedious process that few people have the "taste" to do well.

This is the backdrop against which a16z partner Justine Moore makes her case for **Agentic Video Editing** — a concept she articulated in a [tweet](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/2014002290588615021) and [companion blog post](https://a16z.com/its-time-for-agentic-video-editing/) that quickly resonated across the tech world (787 likes, 67 retweets, 91 replies).

Her thesis is elegantly simple:

> **What Cursor did for coding, AI agents will do for video production.**

## What Is Agentic Video Editing?

Agentic Video Editing isn't just "AI adds a filter" or "auto-generate subtitles." It's a **fundamentally new paradigm** where AI agents serve as your video editing partners, capable of:

1. **Understanding video content** — watching and comprehending massive amounts of footage
2. **Analyzing and planning** — formulating editing strategies like a professional editor
3. **Using tools to execute** — directly operating editing software, not just suggesting changes
4. **Iterating based on feedback** — refining output based on your direction

The key word is **"Agentic"** — not a passive tool, but an active agent. It can not only execute your commands ("cut this section") but proactively propose solutions ("I think the opening is too slow — here's how I'd restructure it...").

## Why Now? Three Technical Breakthroughs

Moore identifies three critical developments that have made this moment possible:

### 1. Vision Models Can Finally Process Large Amounts of Video

You have to understand video before you can edit it — and that's a non-trivial challenge. Even a short clip contains enormous amounts of information.

Recent breakthroughs in multimodal LLMs have changed the game:
- **Gemini 3** can process up to an hour of video
- **GPT-5.2**, **Molmo 2**, and **Vidi2** are inherently multimodal with longer context windows

You can upload video as input and ask models to generate timestamped labels, find specific moments, or summarize what's happening.

### 2. Models Can Now Use Tools

AI video editors need to take action — not just describe what's happening. We're seeing meaningful progress around LLMs as real agents that can use tools.

A striking example: [Claude using Blender](https://x.com/sidahuj/status/1899460492999184534) — a notoriously tricky 3D modeling product that many humans haven't mastered. Imagine how this capability evolves as agents get access to more tools.

### 3. Image and Video Generation Models Have Reached Quality Thresholds

Moore believes many video production pipelines will be **hybrid** — mixing AI-generated and filmed content:
- Film documentary interviews, but generate B-roll or historical footage with AI
- Use motion transfer models to apply reference animations to real characters

These use cases require models to reach sufficient quality and consistency. That threshold has now been crossed.

## Five Core Applications: What Video Agents Will Do

Moore outlines five application areas that form a complete agentic video editing workflow:

### 📁 Process
Whether filming or generating, you end up with far more footage than needed — sometimes by hundreds of times. Think about how many "takes" exist for each scene of a movie.

**Example: [Eddie AI](https://www.heyeddie.ai/)**
- Processes hours of uploaded video
- Identifies A-roll vs. B-roll
- Handles multiple camera angles
- Compares takes

### 🎯 Orchestrate
If many videos will include AI elements, we need agents that **coordinate all the models**. Adding an AI animation to an educational video? You need an agent to generate images, send them to a video model, and stitch outputs together.

**Example: [Glif](https://glif.app/agents)**
- Launches agents that coordinate between multiple models
- Automates multi-model workflows

### ✨ Polish
Fixing small details takes a video from good to great. But non-professionals can be overwhelmed: adjusting lighting between clips, cleaning audio noise, removing filler words.

**Example: [Descript](http://descript.com/)'s Underlord agent**
- Takes your video, makes all the refinements
- Delivers the final version

### 🔄 Adapt
Good video deserves broader reach:
- Cut a YouTube podcast into short clips with different aspect ratios for X, Instagram, TikTok
- Translate and re-dub videos for international audiences

**Example: [Overlap](http://overlap.ai/)**
- Node-based workflows for adaptation tasks

### 🎨 Optimize
The ultimate goal isn't just replacing manual tasks — it's **building agents with taste**. Professional editors spend years learning how to hook viewers, pace storylines, and use music for emotional impact. Thousands of micro-decisions go into every great video.

> YouTuber Emma Chamberlain once said she spent 30-40 hours editing a ~15-minute vlog.

Imagine an AI agent that watches your footage, asks about your objectives, then crafts draft versions for you to iterate on. **You review and direct — "The opening is too slow." "Cut the middle section." "Make the ending hit harder." — and the agent executes.**

## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters

### 1. Video Has Won

Video is how we learn, market, and connect. But the editing bottleneck keeps growing — more footage captured, more platforms to publish on, more formats required.

### 2. This Is AI Agents Applied Vertically

Just as Cursor brought an AI-native experience to code editing, agentic video editing will bring the same revolution to video production. This isn't incremental improvement — it's a **paradigm shift**.

### 3. A Supply-Side Revolution

Video agents will **dramatically expand the supply curve for quality video** — the kind of content that currently requires days or weeks from professional editors will become accessible to everyone.

### 4. Democratization of Creation

Lower barriers mean more people can produce professional-quality video. This isn't just about efficiency — it's about **creative liberation**. When editing is no longer the bottleneck, more people can focus on what truly matters: telling great stories.

## The Cursor Analogy: A Framework for Understanding

Moore's repeated Cursor analogy is illuminating:

| Dimension | Cursor (Code) | Agentic Video Editing |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Understanding | Comprehends codebase context | Comprehends video footage |
| Planning | Plans code modifications | Plans editing strategy |
| Execution | Writes/modifies code directly | Operates editing tools directly |
| Iteration | Adjusts based on feedback | Revises based on director notes |
| Taste | Code quality / best practices | Visual aesthetics / narrative pacing |

The common thread: **humans shift from executor to director**. You no longer need to make every cut and color correction yourself — you guide the AI agent at a higher level.

## Looking Ahead: 2026, the Year Agents Edit

> "2025 was the year of video. 2026 is the year we let agents edit it."
> 
> — Justine Moore

The technology is ready. Vision models, tool-using agents, and massive training datasets have all matured in the past year. The pieces are in place.

AI editing agents will dramatically increase both the **quality** and **velocity** of video creation in the coming months and years.

For creators, this is an exhilarating era. For investors, it's an enormous opportunity. For the video industry, it's an irreversible trend.

The future of video editing isn't you dragging clips on a timeline. It's you telling an agent what feeling you want — and it makes it happen.
