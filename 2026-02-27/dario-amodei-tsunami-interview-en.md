# Dario Amodei Deep Interview: The Tsunami Is on the Horizon, but Nobody Is Looking

> **TL;DR**: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei sat down with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath in Bangalore for a 1+ hour interview. Key thesis: **The AI tsunami is visible on the horizon, but society keeps saying "that is just a trick of the light."** Technical safety work is going better than expected, societal awareness is going worse — they "roughly cancel out." Coding will be replaced first, Anthropic won't compete in "wrapper" domains but will compete directly in code. Critical thinking is humanity's last edge.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- **Spotted scaling laws during GPT-2 era (2019)**, convinced OpenAI leadership, but disagreed on safety approach — left to found Anthropic
- **Built Claude 1 before ChatGPT** (2022), chose not to release it to avoid an arms race — "probably gave up the consumer AI lead"
- **Technical safety better than expected, societal awareness worse** — "roughly cancel out"
- Anthropic co-founder fed personal journal to Claude — **Claude accurately predicted fears he "hadn't written down yet"**
- **Coding will be replaced first by AI**, then broader software engineering. Long-term, AI will likely surpass humans at "basically everything"
- Don't build **Claude wrappers** — build industry moats. Anthropic's India revenue doubled in 3.5 months
- Bullish on **peptide therapies and CAR-T** — AI-driven biotech "about to have a renaissance"

## 🌊 "The Tsunami Is on the Horizon"

> These models are very close to human intelligence, but society doesn't seem to broadly appreciate what's about to happen. It's as if this tsunami is coming at us, we can see it on the horizon, and yet people are saying "that's not actually a tsunami, that's just a trick of the light."

Two dimensions:
- **Technical optimism**: Interpretability research exceeded expectations — found neurons mapping to specific concepts, circuits tracking poetic meter
- **Social pessimism**: The world is severely underprepared for AI's impact

## 🏃 From Biologist to AI: Driven by Despair

Dario isn't CS-trained. Physics undergrad, biophysics PhD, wanted to be a professor curing diseases. Hit a wall with protein complexity — realized AI might be the ultimate tool for biology after seeing AlexNet. Worked at Baidu (Andrew Ng's team), Google, then joined OpenAI months after founding and led research for years.

> "Don't argue with someone else's vision. If you have a strong vision, you should just go off and do your own thing."

## ⚖️ Power Concentration & Safety Actions

Three concrete safety actions:
1. **Didn't release Claude 1 in 2022** — avoided arms race at significant business cost
2. **Actively supported California SB 53** — the only major AI company, when all others and the US government opposed it
3. **LTBT (Long-Term Benefit Trust)** — independent body with no financial ties, eventually empowered to appoint majority board members

## 🤖 AI Knows You Better Than You Know Yourself

A co-founder fed his personal journal to Claude. Claude said: "Here are fears you probably have but haven't written down yet." Most were correct.

> Something that deeply understands you can be an angel on your shoulder — or it can exploit that understanding to manipulate you. If you're not paying for the product, you ARE the product.

This is why Anthropic doesn't do ads.

## 💼 Advice for Founders

**Don't build wrappers.** Just putting a UI on Claude has zero moat.

**High-moat directions:** Bio × AI, financial services, anything with deep domain barriers.

**But Anthropic will compete in core areas:** "Claude Code is something we use ourselves. In code, we've become a very strong competitor."

**The sphere of what AI can do expands every 2-3 months.** Not a static market — a constantly inflating possibility sphere.

## 🎓 What Should Young People Learn?

1. **People-centric work** — longer runway for interpersonal roles
2. **Physical world** — semiconductors and areas AI hasn't fully covered
3. **Critical thinking** — when AI can generate everything, distinguishing real from fake becomes the most important skill

> Even if you only do 5% of the task because AI does the other 95%, your output is amplified 20x. Comparative advantage is surprisingly powerful.

## 🔮 "You Can Predict the Future for Free"

> People are tempted to believe "that can't happen." But again and again, simply extrapolating curves gives counter-intuitive conclusions almost nobody believes. You can predict the future for free just by saying "well it stands to reason that..."
