# Recraft V4: AI Image Generation with Actual Design Taste

**February 2026**

---

## TL;DR

Recraft V4 is a new-generation AI image model released February 2026, built around "design taste" — balanced composition, cohesive color, refined detail. Outputs look like designer work, not AI stock images. Supports both raster and vector (SVG) modes.

The following images were generated by Recraft V4:

## What Sets It Apart

### 1. Design Taste — Not Just Accuracy

This is Recraft V4's core differentiator. It's not just about understanding prompts — it's about producing images with **genuine design sensibility**:
- Balanced composition, not random element placement
- Cohesive color palettes with intentional tone
- Refined detail without over-processing
- Results that feel "designed" rather than "generated"

### 2. Chinese Prompt Support

While it can't render Chinese text within images, it **fully supports Chinese-language prompts**. Describe your vision in Chinese and the model understands accurately.

### 3. Relaxed Content Moderation

Compared to competitors that aggressively filter (often blocking legitimate creative content), Recraft V4's moderation is more reasonable, giving creators more freedom.

### 4. Excellent Chinese Aesthetic Performance

Particularly strong with traditional Chinese visual themes — shadow puppet portraits, qipao fashion, ink wash styles. Outperforms competitors like Banana Pro on these subjects.

### 5. Vector Output

Supports both raster and SVG vector output. Vector versions can be used directly for logos, icons, and illustrations without post-processing conversion.

## Why This Matters

Recraft V4 represents a shift from "accurate" to "beautiful" in AI image generation. Previous models focused on understanding prompts and generating correct content. Recraft V4 focuses on **producing work with design taste**.

For designers, brands, and content creators, this means AI-generated images can finally be **used in production without heavy editing**.
