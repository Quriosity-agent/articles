# One-Click Oiran Transformation: A Masterclass in Character Costume Prompt Engineering

> **TL;DR**: 古一 (@MANISH1027512) shared an incredibly detailed AI image generation prompt that transforms any portrait into a **Japanese Oiran (courtesan) style**. More than just a prompt — it's a **structured template for character costume transformation**, covering 11 dimensions: identity consistency, composition, pose, makeup, hairstyle, clothing materials, props/setting, lighting, quality, and negative constraints. Works with GPT-4o, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or any model supporting Character Reference.

## Why This Prompt Matters

Most costume transformation prompts are one-liners: "make this person look like an oiran." Results are random, faces distort.

This prompt's brilliance is **structured control** — it breaks a complex image generation task into 11 independently controllable dimensions, each with explicit "allowed" and "forbidden" rules.

## The 11-Dimension Structure

### 1. Task — One sentence defining the overall effect
### 2. Identity Consistency ⭐ (Most Critical)
- ✅ Allowed: makeup, hair, clothing, pose, props, environment, lighting
- ❌ Forbidden: face swapping, generic beautification, anime style, excessive smoothing

### 3. Composition — Vertical 2:3, slightly high angle, handheld realism
### 4. Pose — Kneeling on tatami, fan covering face, cold gaze from fan edge
### 5. Makeup — Cool-toned pale base, red "drunken/yandere" eyeshadow, deep crimson lips
### 6. Hairstyle — High updo, gold tassel pins, large red flower
### 7. Clothing — Red-black brocade kimono, high-sheen satin with strong fold reflections
### 8. Props — Black-red folding fan, oil-paper umbrella, hanging white wisteria
### 9. Lighting — **On-camera direct flash** (the cleverest detail), hard shadows, dark background
### 10. Quality — Realistic photography, slight grain/noise, authentic snapshot feel
### 11. Negative Constraints — No studio softbox, no cinematic glow, no sweet smiles, no extra fingers

## Reusable Prompt Engineering Techniques

| Dimension | Universal Application |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Identity Consistency | Every costume change needs explicit "change what / keep what" |
| Negative Constraints | More specific negatives = less AI drift |
| Lighting specification | "Direct flash" vs "softbox" vs "natural" completely changes mood |
| Material description | "High-sheen satin fold reflections" >> "nice clothes" |
| Pose details | "Glancing from fan edge" >> "looking at camera" |
